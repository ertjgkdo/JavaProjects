# PARKING SYSTEM
## Description
A command line parking application for vehicles of various types. 

## Features
Keeps track of which vehicle is parked, how many slots are available for which vehicle type, and how many are not available. We can get a display of the available slots in each floor of the parking lot based on the vehicle type too.   

## NOTE:
Followed the tutorial provided by Kunal Nalawade through freecodecamp website: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/java-project-parking-lot-management-system/#project-requirements
HOWEVER, certain things in the code like encapsulation, exceptional handling done selfly.
